## Learning objectives

The learning objectives of this project are to understand :

* what are variadic functions

* how to use `va_start`, `va_arg` and `va_end` macros

* why and how to use the `cont` type qualifier

### Tasks

* **0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant**

  * `0-sum_them_all.c`
	* **Prototype** : int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...);
	* Returns the sum of all its parameters
	* [!TIP] If n == 0, return 0
